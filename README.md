# Fire-detection-sensor

### Arduino is there to connect to sensors. This code consists of a temperature sensor, a flame sensor, and a gas sensor, and if you want to connect other sensors, you can modify the code to add more.

### The Python code outputs the values ​​from the sensors and, in case of a fire, sends the sensor information and the room number in which they are installed to Firebase.
